            I am an IT enthusiast with a relentless drive to constantly improve
            myself for the benefit of the company and the team I work with. My
            passion lies in web development, which I see as a powerful medium to
            connect people through the internet. Being part of this dynamic
            field is one of my favorite aspects of my career. I have experience
            working as a full-stack and backend developer, but my current
            specialization is in frontend development. My expertise includes
            React, TypeScript, CSS, and NextJS, as well as a strong
            understanding of design patterns and performance optimization.
            Additionally, I utilize Jest for testing to ensure the quality and
            reliability of the code.

              <h4>October 2022 - Present</h4>
              <p>
                A client-side application was developed for the organization and
                management of different clients worldwide using the client's
                platform. The main task was characterized by the creation of
                high-quality and efficient code, always aiming to meet the
                client's needs while maintaining code that is maintainable and
                easy to understand for both current and future developers.
                Throughout this project, tools such as React, NextJS, CSS, and
                TSX were used to create user interface components, significantly
                enhancing the development team's skills. From the beginning,
                being part of a project with a large number of potential users
                required implementing everything in the best possible way.
                Skills with React and TypeScript improved significantly, as
                these were the languages used in the project. Various
                functionalities were implemented using React hooks, such as
                useContext, which allows values to be shared between components
                without the need to pass props manually; useEffect, which
                handles side effects in functional components; and useState,
                which manages local component state. Additionally, custom hooks
                were created on several occasions to facilitate reuse by the
                development team. TanStack (formerly React Table) was also used
                to create tables with information received from the backend.
                TanStack is a powerful library that facilitates the management
                and display of tabular data in React applications, providing
                advanced functionalities such as pagination, filtering, and
                sorting of data. It is important to highlight that soft skills
                were also significantly enhanced. The ability to communicate
                with the client and team members was recognized by the team, as
                well as the effort to deliver all tickets on time and with
                exceptional quality. Finally, testing was not overlooked.
                Various tests were conducted using Jest to ensure that any
                modifications were backed by unit tests, thereby guaranteeing
                the stability and reliability of the code.

              <p>
                An administration panel was developed for a cybersecurity
                company, focusing on modernizing the existing codebase written
                in ES5. The primary goal was to improve the old code without
                breaking the current application, as the code was originally
                designed with ES5, and the client specifically requested a
                refactor. The solutions implemented aimed at enhancing
                functionality while ensuring backward compatibility. The
                effectiveness of these solutions was reflected in various
                metrics, including commit logs and the resolution rate of bugs
                associated with my closed tickets. Despite being a new
                technology and environment for me, the effectiveness rate was
                approximately 92%, demonstrating a successful adaptation to the
                new technology and team dynamics. As a full-stack developer, I
                was involved in both backend and frontend tasks. On the backend,
                I focused on refactoring server responses to optimize
                performance and ensure data integrity. Concurrently, on the
                frontend, I improved the presentation of information to the
                client by updating and refactoring CSS and HTML. Special
                attention was given to security, particularly to prevent users
                from injecting malicious JavaScript, thereby mitigating
                potential hacking risks. The project also involved implementing
                modern best practices and tools. For instance, I introduced ES6+
                features where appropriate to enhance code readability and
                maintainability. This included using arrow functions, template
                literals, and destructuring assignments, which contributed to
                cleaner and more efficient code. Additionally, thorough testing
                was conducted to ensure the stability and reliability of the
                refactored code. Unit tests and integration tests were
                implemented using Jest, which provided a robust testing
                framework to validate the functionality of both new and existing
                features. Communication and collaboration were key components of
                the project's success. Regular meetings with the client and the
                development team ensured that all changes aligned with the
                client's expectations and project goals. Detailed documentation
                was also created to facilitate knowledge transfer and onboarding
                for new team members. Overall, the project significantly
                improved the administration panel's performance, security, and
                user experience, aligning with the cybersecurity company's
                stringent standards and requirements.

          <h5 style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: #e63946">1+ years</h5>
          <p>
            Being a teacher has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding
            experiences of my professional career. For the past year, I have
            taught various subjects, including Project Management, Web
            Application Development (using React and JavaScript), and
            Programming Methodology. In the latter, I designed a unique approach
            to teaching the fundamentals of programming by incorporating
            different perspectives, tools, expression forms, and languages. This
            has allowed me to improve my engagement with the next generation of
            developers. Thanks to this significant challenge, I have greatly
            enhanced my communication skills. Being a teacher requires not only
            knowledge but also empathy and the determination to always present a
            positive and willing attitude to students, regardless of personal
            circumstances. Over my year in this profession, I have witnessed
            remarkable outcomes from my students, which have exceeded my
            expectations. This might sound boastful, but I speak from a place of
            honesty and the genuine feedback from my students. They have enjoyed
            my classes and discovered the vast field of web development and
            programming through my teaching. I have evidence of projects where
            students, starting with zero knowledge in technologies like React
            and JavaScript, completed the semester with full-stack projects
            using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB or MySQL, and of course,
            JavaScript. Fostering student talent is crucial. A teacher should
            guide and support rather than criticize harshly. The primary role of
            a teacher is to educate. This profession has exponentially improved
            my skills in using React, JavaScript, and in areas such as planning,
            estimation, complexity scoring, public speaking, and keeping
            students engaged. Above all, it has made me more human.
